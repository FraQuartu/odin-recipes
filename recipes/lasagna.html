        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> 
            This is an homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
            A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and parmesan.

        <p>
            We suggest to serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
